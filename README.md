Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download and Install XAMPP:**
   - Download XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Install it on your computer.

2. **Move Files to htdocs:**
   - After installation, locate the "htdocs" folder inside the XAMPP installation directory (usually `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).
   - Place your project files inside this "htdocs" folder.

3. **Access phpMyAdmin:**
   - Open any web browser and go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

4. **Create Database:**
   - Click on the "Databases" tab.
   - Enter a database name (use the same name as your SQL file, if possible).
   - Click "Create."

5. **Import SQL File:**
   - Select the newly created database from the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Import" in the top menu.
   - Choose your SQL file using the "Browse" button.
   - Click "Go" to import the SQL file.

6. **Access Your Website:**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Go to [http://localhost/your_project_folder](http://localhost/your_project_folder).
   - Make sure to replace "your_project_folder" with the actual name of your project folder.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure XAMPP is running before accessing localhost.
- Verify the correct port if you have changed it.
- Make sure your SQL file and database names match for seamless integration.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up your XAMPP server, create a database, import the SQL file, and access project on localhost.
